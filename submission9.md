   ![alt text](images/vulnerability_count.png)
   - Most interesting vulnerability found: **Cross-Domain Misconfiguration**, as any domain can make requests to the Juice Shop and get a response, even if the request comes from a malicious origin. This misconfiguration allows arbitrary third-party websites to send requests to Juice Shopâ€™s APIs and read the responses. While browsers block credentialed CORS by default, any unauthenticated or IP-based access controls are effectively bypassed. This could be abused to leak open data, exploit browser-side weaknesses, or perform phishing-style attacks.
